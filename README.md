# BrewberryPi - by Morgan Stimpson
Use a Raspberry Pi to study the fermentation rate of wort or other fermentable liquids.

Equipment:
1. Raspberry Pi - Pico
2. Breadboard
3. Wiring
4. Sensor:
4a. PH Sensor // the acidity of the liquid will kill of the yeast and prevent further fermentation
4b. O2 Sensor // once most of the O2 is gone the yeast stops reproducing and begins the bulk of the fermentation
4c. CO2 Sensor // this will have a relation with the O2, but not sure exactly at the moment
4d. others // I can not remember at the moment

Pipeline:
1. Produce 1 working model of the Pico board
2. Equip a fermentation tank with sensors
3. Let wort ferment into beer.
4. Store data into an excell or similar style sheet.
5. Train on the model to create a generic model.
6. Use the data to predict for the next batch?

Development: -- Due by April 1st?
1. Get a raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Find some sensors.
3. Get a bread board.
4. Work on the hardware.
