# BrewberryPi - by Morgan Stimpson
Use a Raspberry Pi to study the fermentation rate of wort or other fermentable liquids.

Equipment:
-Raspberry Pi - Pico
-Breadboard
-Wiring
-Sensor:
-- PH Sensor // the acidity of the liquid will kill of the yeast and prevent further fermentation
-- O2 Sensor // once most of the O2 is gone the yeast stops reproducing and begins the bulk of the fermentation
-- CO2 Sensor // this will have a relation with the O2, but not sure exactly at the moment
-- others // I can not remember at the moment
